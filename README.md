# Video Speedup Hotkeys (User Script)
User script for speeding up videos on various video viewing platforms. Can be used with browser extensions such as Greasemonkey, Violentmonkey and Tampermonkey.

If you already have one of these extensions, you can install the script by clicking here: [video_speedup_hotkeys.user.js](https://github.com/Sanian-Creations/video_speedup_hotkeys/raw/main/video_speedup_hotkeys.user.js)

## Hotkeys
* A - Video speed -1 (hold shift for -0.25)
* D - Video speed +1 (hold shift for +0.25)
* S - Skip ahead by 1:27 seconds, nice for skipping past anime intros
* Shift + S - Toggle pitch preservation. Pitch preservation is on by defualt. (Example: with pitch preservation off, sped up videos will get higher pitched.)
* Ctrl click the screen to open a little menu with a few more options
